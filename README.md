# Kassech Public Transportation Optimization System (KPTOS) üöóüõ£Ô∏è

## Overview

The **Intelligent Transportation Management System (ITMS)** is a robust and scalable solution designed to streamline transportation operations by effectively managing vehicles, drivers, routes, and passenger data. It provides real-time insights into car movements, tracks routes, and optimizes resource allocation for transportation businesses or public transit systems.

With a focus on efficiency, flexibility, and security, ITMS employs geospatial data to monitor and log routes, enabling advanced analytics, path optimization, and improved decision-making. This system is ideal for organizations looking to digitize and enhance their transportation processes.

## Features

- **Dynamic Route Management**:  
  - Bidirectional route definitions with support for alternative paths.  
  - Geospatial storage and visualization of routes using modern databases.

- **Vehicle and Driver Management**:  
  - Assign vehicles to drivers dynamically.  
  - Track ownership and delegate driving tasks seamlessly.

- **Passenger Analytics**:  
  - Register and log passenger counts at specific times and locations without storing personal information.

- **Journey Tracking**:  
  - Store and analyze paths traveled by vehicles using geospatial data (latitude, longitude).  
  - Support for geospatial queries to calculate distances, analyze travel patterns, and optimize routes.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:  
  - Secure system access with dynamic roles and permissions for administrators, drivers, and vehicle owners.

- **Event Logging**:  
  - Notifications and travel logs for auditing and performance analysis.

- **High Customizability**:  
  - Flexible data structures to accommodate specific organizational needs.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**:  
  - Node.js/Express or Laravel for API-driven architecture.  
  - Relational Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) with geospatial extensions (PostGIS).

- **Frontend**:  
  - React or Angular for an interactive user interface.

- **Geospatial Tools**:  
  - PostGIS/MySQL for storing and querying geospatial data.  
  - Integration with mapping APIs (Google Maps, OpenStreetMap).

- **Security**:  
  - Advanced role-based access control (RBAC).  
  - Encrypted communication and data storage.
